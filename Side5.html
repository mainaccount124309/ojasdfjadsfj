<h1 style="color:red;"> This page is going to tell you what animating and scripting is, not how to earn further Robux/money. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Animating: There are two main forms of animating; the one Roblox made for you and Moon animator. The one Roblox made for you is more so meant for models and unioned parts, meanwhile Moon animator is meant for humanoid rigs and holdable items. As said, you should always make sure to union limbs on a model if it is meant to be alive. So, if you make a robot for example, you can union the limbs and animate much much easier in the Roblox animator. Moon animator however, is an animator you have to pay for, but a high quality animator at that. Roblox characters (we will talk about R6) are made of blocks, like a lego. This makes it much easier to animate them overall. Moon animator is generally better for animating these Roblox bodies and rigs. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Scripting: You open a bar where you write, well, scripts. Here are things where you script things where you use your brain and make things, well, do things. So you can edit the total amount of HP something has, or how much damage a weapon does, or how your AI will move/act. Scripting is generally crucial for a high quality game, especially the really good passion projects. If you want a big popular well constructed Roblox game based on a complicated gameplay, you are likely to need a lot of scripting. Also, scripting and programming are different. </h1>

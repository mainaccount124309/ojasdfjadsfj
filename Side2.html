<h1 style="color:white;"> Tip 1: Think of what you want before making it. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Tip 2: To get better faster, try to use a minimal amount of free models. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Tip 3: Try to union limbs so the model can be animated easily in the future, if you are hoping to make a game. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Tip 4: Small details can make bigger details than you think, small details enhance the model a lot, so if you wanna make a big model of something, try to make small details too. </h1>

<h1 style="color:white;"> Tip 5: You can change the material of parts too, so unless you are making a colorful cartoony model, materials can make the model much much better and nicer to look at. </h1>

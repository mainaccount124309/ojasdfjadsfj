<h1 style=color:white;"> Tip 1: To find a group or person to work for, you can go in a Discord server or a Roblox plaza game and find someone there. </h1>
<h1 style=color:white;"> Tip 2: It is important to negotiate prices on things first, and how the payment will work, for example; do you want to get paid each model? Or maybe you wanna get paid on how long you will work for? It is important to negotiate before anything. </h1>
<h1 style=color:white;"> Tip 3: I heavily advise calculating and planning out what deals you are going to make. Basically, if you are making a game, you want developers but you need to work for someone else too, try to make sure you get paid more than you pay your own developers. For example: You can get paid 1,000 robux each model, and pay your devs 800 each model they make. It sounds more greedy than it really is. </h1>

Tip 4: You can sell to multiple developers at once, and not just modelling. You can animate, model, create and script for other developers as well, and even multiple at a time. Animators and Scripters tend to get highly paid, so if you are going to roblox studio only to earn Robux and money, I advise learning scripting/animating or even both. </h1>
